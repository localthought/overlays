# Moneybird readable-record metadata

These overlays accompany the generated read-only Moneybird OpenAPI document at
commit `85a6105220036a98ef0d7cd6f228d4aae0036508` in the OpenAPI directory.

`crud-causality-overlay.yaml` describes record identity, collections, object
reads, and response Links. The contact-to-subscriptions relation uses standard
Link request context plus the proposed `x-for-each` item binding; publication
of that dependency waits for the filtering/Link proposal review.

`all-records-selection-overlay.yaml` is deliberately separate. Its query
values request archived, inactive, billed, and unbilled records for an “all
records” import. Those values are consumer choices rather than claims about
Moneybird's default API behavior.

Regenerate and validate from a checkout containing the generated OpenAPI
document:
